Port of [Google's material design icons for Android Lollipop 5.0](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) to Linux.  
Some icons (i.e., the ones that did not have an equivalent in the material design icon set) have been created manually. These missing icons were influenced by Ubuntu Mono and Mint-X.  

This is still a work in progress, but it's close to complete.
